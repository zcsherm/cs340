-- Find all films with maximum length or minimum replacement cost (compared to all other % films).
-- In other words let L be the maximum film length, and let R be the minimum replacement cost in the table film. 
-- You need to find all films that have length L or replacement cost R or both length L and replacement cost R.
-- If a film has either a maximum length OR a minimum replacement cost it should appear in the result set. 
-- It does not need to have both the maximum length AND minimum replacement cost.
-- You just need to return the film_id for this query.
-- Order your results by film_id in ascending order.

-- Put query for Q1 here
SELECT film.film_id FROM film WHERE
(
film.length = SELECT MAX(length) FROM film
)
  OR
(
film.replacement_cost = SELECT MIN(film.replacement_cost) FROM film
) ASC;
